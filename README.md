## Greetings
## Who Am I
My name is Isaiah Gamble. Yes, I use my real name for GitHub.

I enjoy creative works the most, followed by anything that involves a spreadsheet.

## Recent Projects
A video-game team balancer based on analysis of individual impact

The analysis and generation of compassionate stories for use in medical schools

Some small video games, recently one for my daughter based on Peppa Pig's "Happy Mrs Chicken"

A few screen-plays
